  <p>I am studying <a href="https://cs.unc.edu/">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://art.unc.edu/">Studio Art</a> at UNC-Chapel Hill. When the internet first started, it was so foreign and hard to navigate because UX/UI was neglected; if this
    had not been the case, the internet would have been accessible much faster than it was. This is why I am so passionate about creating universally intuitive interfaces.</p>
